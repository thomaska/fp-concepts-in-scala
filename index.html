## What does Functional Programming even mean?

It's all about programming with functions!

---
## What does Functional Programming even mean?

It's all about programming with functions!

But what is a function?!

---

## What does Functional Programming even mean?

Let's think of mathematical functions

\\(f(x) = x^2 + 3*x + 4\\)

\\(e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0\\)
---

## Mathematical function properties

---

## Mathematical function properties
* They always return the same result for the same input - Deterministic
* For every input they return an output - Total
* The only effect is the specific calculation - Pure

---

## What is x?

\\(y=3\\)

\\(z=2*y\\)

\\(x=z^2 - z\\)

---
## Substitute and solve

\\(y=3\\)

\\(z=2*y\\)

\\(x=z^2 - z\\)

<br>
\\(x = (2 \times y)^2 - 2 * y\\)

\\(x = (2 \times 3)^2 - 2 \times 3\\)

\\(x=30\\)

## Could you do the same with code?

## Could you do the same with code?

```scala
val it = List(1, 2, 3).iterator
val y = it.next()
val x = y^2 + y
```

---

## Could you do the same with code?

```scala
val it = List(1, 2, 3).iterator
val y = it.next()
val x = y^2 + y
```

```scala
var x = y^2 + y
x = it.next()^2 + it.next()
x = 1^2 + 2
x = 3
```

## So what are the benefits of functional programming?
* Better reasoning about our programs - equational reasoning
* Easier to refactor
* Correctness of the code can be inferred locally - local reasoning
* Leverage the type system, writing more expressive code

## Recap - How to write purely functional code
* Make all your functions total
* Use recursion where appropriate
* Leverage the type system, narrow down your domain
* Defer the execution of impure operations
---
## Recap - Is it for me?
* Writing pure functional code adds restrictions to your code
* Those restrictions make it easier to reason about your program
* It takes some time to get used to it
* The trade-off when writing something small and self contained, maybe is not worth it
* If you decide to do it, stick to it
