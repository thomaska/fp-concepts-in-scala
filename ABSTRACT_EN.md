# Talk Abstract

In this session, we will try to apply Functional Programming principles and iteratively improve a procedural program.

It will be an interactive, partially live coding session, using Scala. No prior knowledge of Scala is required, although it would be a plus.

The purpose of this session would be to understand the pros and cons of writing purely functional code and hopefully get convinced to use some of those concepts in your everyday life.
